# A Newspaper for Men
## A study on the gender distribution of writers at the New York Times

We all read news with implicit biases. From our own political views to those of the company's and reporter's, attempting to escape political, social, or other frames is futile. That is, frames dissuade us from thinking, or nudge us toward predetermined thought patterns. Whether we’re watching a fifteen-second TV ad or reading a carefully laid-out newspaper, the frame imposed on the content affects how we receive it. In news, the sum of our experiences preceding *what* we read determines *how* we read it. We know this, and many actively try to read works from both the left and right. This leads to my question: **Why don't we recognize these same frames in gender?**

What I want to say in the next paragraph:
- In fact, we each view the world through our own set of internal frames, shaped by every experience we’ve had and every word we’ve heard and uttered.
- men and women have internal differences that biologically differ their outlooks on what they write
- more importantly, the social landscapes for men and women are vastly different: from how they're raised, how they're spoken to, and societal 'norms'
